# STFT-KAN Framework

## Overview

We propose a new **Kolmogorov-Arnold Network (KAN)**, called **STFT-KAN**, which introduces **Short-Time Fourier Transform (STFT)** into KAN. The **STFT-KAN framework** allows for the use of different window sizes across various frequency ranges, providing a more adaptable and efficient way to represent underlying signals by capturing nonstationary frequency characteristics. This enhanced Fourier-based KAN formulation offers better control over model parameters, reducing the risk of overfitting while preserving performance similar to that of the original KAN model.

We have two sections: the first section [STFT-KAN Benchmarking](#stft-kan-benchmarking) focuses on evaluating STFT-KAN on general tasks like MNIST digit classification. The second section [Paper Implementation Code](#paper-implementation-code) details the method introduced in our paper, where STFT-KAN is applied to 3D point cloud classification of tree species using Dynamic Graph CNN (DGCNN).

## STFT-KAN Benchmarking

### STFT-KAN on MNIST

To experiment with **STFT-KAN** on a general task like **MNIST digit classification**, execute:
```bash
cd "STFT-KAN Benchmarking"  
python mnist.py
```
In this example, we use the same architecture for all layers to classify MNIST digits after feature extraction using a pretrained ResNet18. Note that our goal is to demonstrate how STFT-KAN is flexible in complexity control, so we choose the hyperparameters of other KAN models in a way that minimizes the parameter count. For the MLP, we use ReLU activation.

This table represents the results with different parameter combinations for STFT-KAN: STFTKANlayer (grid_size, window_size, stride).

We can see that even though STFT-KAN does not use nonlinear complex transformations, we can find hyperparameters that minimize the parameter count compared to other KANs, while still achieving competitive accuracy with MLP.
